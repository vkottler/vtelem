# Documentation

([back](../README.md#documentation))

This project's documentation covers primarily the _protocol_ implemented,
including both serialization and intended semantics.

The goal is not to necessarily provide a ground-truth implementation, but a
pragmatic specification for how arbitrary applications running on arbitrary
platforms can communicate information via telemetry and messages.
