  - name: "agnostic"
    value: 0
    summary: >-
      A message that has no protocol-defined interpretation.
    description: |
      This message type can be used to send an arbitrary payload, it is useful
      for testing of the message-transport correctness itself or as an
      application-defined encapsulation.
  - name: "text"
    value: 1
    summary: >-
      A message that should be interpreted as
      [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)-encoded, plain text.
    description: |
      This message type contains text. It is discouraged to encode an
      additional layer of decoding assistance (such as a String identifier)
      within this generic message. It is also discouraged to perform "logging"
      with this message as [`stream`](message.md#stream) frames are intended
      for such use-cases. If and when text-based messages serve practical
      purposes for the protocol itself, they should exist as message types
      distinct from this one despite also containing text.
  - name: "json"
    value: 2
    summary: >-
      A message that should be interpreted as
      [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)-encoded,
      arbitrary [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html).
    description: |
      This message contains [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)-encoded
      data. Like the [`text`](message_type.md#text) message, if and when
      delivery of protocol or application metadata commonly bootstraps
      functionality, a new message type shall be defined and shall offer a
      supplementing schema.

      Application's may use this message to send application data, but they
      must implement logic for determining the data's purpose.
  - name: "enum"
    value: 3
    summary: >-
      A message that should be interpreted as
      [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)-encoded
      [UserEnum](serializable.md#userenum) data.
    description: |
      This message contains runtime enumeration data. Whether by using the
      `name` attribute (to identify a protocol-significant enumeration) or
      defining further protocol-specific messages, a runtime enumeration may
      have significance at the protocol level. Other enumerations may only be
      significant to the application or runtime context.
  - name: "enum_registry"
    value: 4
    summary: >-
      A message that should be interpreted as
      [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)-encoded
      [EnumRegistry](serializable.md#enumregistry) data.
    description: |
      This message contains a registry of runtime enumerations. Enumerations
      are mapped to integer identifiers so they can be referenced as integers
      when a type reference should be packed into a frame or message.
  - name: "primitive"
    value: 5
    summary: >-
      A message that should be interpreted as
      [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)-encoded
      [SerializablePrimitive](serializable.md#serializableprimitive) data.
    description: |
      This message describes a fundamental type. It can be used by bespoke
      implementations to corroborate how numerical, boolean or other values
      should be interpreted.

      A primitive type can be assigned an integer value so that an entity
      transferred via this protocol can express the type of that entity by that
      value (also requiring the "primitive type mapping" to be exchanged in
      advance).
