entries:
- name: "agnostic"
  value: 0
  summary: >-
    A message that has no protocol-defined interpretation.
  description: |
    This message type can be used to send an arbitrary payload, it is useful
    for testing of the message-transport correctness itself or as an
    application-defined encapsulation.
- name: "text"
  value: 1
  summary: >-
    A message that should be interpreted as
    [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)-encoded, plain text.
  description: |
    This message type contains text. It is discouraged to encode an additional
    layer of decoding assistance (such as a String identifier) within this
    generic message. It is also discouraged to perform "logging" with this
    message as [`stream`](message.md#stream) frames are intended for such
    use-cases. If and when text-based messages serve practical purposes for
    the protocol itself, they should exist as message types distinct from this
    one despite also containing text.
- name: "json"
  value: 2
  summary: >-
    A message that should be interpreted as
    [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)-encoded,
    arbitrary [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html).
  description: |
    This message contains [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)-encoded
    data. Like the [`text`](message_type.md#text) message, if and when delivery
    of protocol or application metadata commonly bootstraps functionality, a
    new message type shall be defined and shall offer a supplementing schema.

    Application's may use this message to send application data, but they must
    implement logic for determining the data's purpose.
