  value: 0
  summary: >-
    A frame type of zero is not considered any kind of frame, though it is
    sometimes useful to use when testing protocol or client/server machinery
    without any real data to transfer.
  description: |
    No further interpretation of an `invalid` frame can be made. If a client
    is expecting to process real data and encounters this frame, discard and
    move on to the next delivery of the frame-encapsulating transmission.

    If the transport mechanism is stream-oriented and can't distinguish
    discrete transmissions, the client should close the stream and indicate
    error.
- name: "data"
  value: 1
  summary: >-
    A simple frame containing an array of channel indices followed by channel
    data appearing in the same order as indicated by the array of indices.
  description: "TODO."
- name: "event"
  value: 2
  summary: >-
    A simple frame containing an array of channel indices followed by an
    "event" structure containing a "previous" and "current" pair of values and
    timestamps. This frame is useful for data that warrants asynchronous
    updates more than synchronous ones.
